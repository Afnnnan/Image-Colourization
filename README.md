# GAN Image-to-Image Translation

Welcome to the GAN Image-to-Image Translation project! This repository contains the implementation of a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) architecture for transforming grayscale images into color images using the CIFAR-10 dataset.

## Overview

In this project, we explore the fascinating realm of image-to-image translation using state-of-the-art deep learning techniques. Our goal is to leverage the power of GANs to generate high-quality color images from grayscale inputs, offering a novel approach to digital image enhancement.

## Key Features

- **Advanced GAN Architecture**: The GAN architecture is carefully designed to balance the generator and discriminator networks, ensuring stable training and high-quality image generation.
- **Enhanced Training Procedure**: We employ novel training strategies, including progressive training and spectral normalization, to enhance convergence and mitigate mode collapse.
- **Interactive Evaluation Tools**: Our project includes interactive tools for visualizing and evaluating the performance of the trained GAN, allowing users to explore the generated colorizations in real-time.
